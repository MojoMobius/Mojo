<h1>What is FPDF?</h1>

<p>FPDF is a PHP class which allows to generate PDF files with pure PHP, that is to say
without using the PDFlib library. F from FPDF stands for Free: you may use it for any kind
of usage and modify it to suit your needs.</p>

<p>FPDF has other advantages: high level functions. Here is a list of its main features:</p>

<ul style="margin-left:0.7em; padding-left:0.7em">
<li>Choice of measure unit, page format and margins</li>
<li>Page header and footer management</li>
<li>Automatic page break</li>
<li>Automatic line break and text justification</li>
<li>Image support (JPEG, PNG and GIF)</li>
<li>Colors</li>
<li>Links</li>
<li>TrueType, Type1 and encoding support</li>
<li>Page compression</li>
</ul>

<p>FPDF requires no extension (except Zlib to enable compression and GD for GIF support).
The latest version requires at least PHP 5.1.</p>

<p>The <a href="tutorial/index.php">tutorials</a> will give you a quick start. The complete
online documentation is <a href="doc/index.php">here</a> and download area is
<a href="download.php">there</a>. It is strongly advised to read the <a href="FAQ.php">FAQ</a>
which lists the most common questions and issues.</p>

<p>A <a href="script/index.php">script</a> section is available and provides some useful extensions
(such as bookmarks, rotations, tables, barcodes...).

</p><h1>What languages can I use?</h1>

<p>The class can produce documents in many languages other than the Western European ones: Central
European, Cyrillic, Greek, Baltic and <a href="/en/script/script87.php">Thai</a>,
provided you own TrueType or Type1 fonts with the desired character set.
<a href="/en/script/script92.php">UTF-8 support</a> is also available.</p>

<h1>What about performance?</h1>

<p>Of course, the generation speed of the document is less than with PDFlib. However, the
performance penalty keeps very reasonable and suits in most cases, unless your documents are
particularly complex or heavy.</p>
